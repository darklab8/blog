		TODO articles
			- write article about refactoring legacy code based on your AWS Step functions experience?
			- write: raising ECS cluster (especially powered by EC2)
			- write article about making pet projects
				- https://discord.com/channels/838802001861017662/842969729336344614/1204779829258354739

			- refactor python docker containers article ( https://github.com/darklab8/darklab_article_docker_python )
			- refactor "personal docs as git-crypt"
				- https://github.com/darklab8/darklab_article_documentation_as_a_code
				- https://darklab8.github.io/darklab_article_documentation_as_a_code/
			- refactor "parallel pytest"
				- (needs code refactor. Very Ugly. But small amoutn of code)
				- https://github.com/darklab8/darklab_article_parallel_pytest
			- write: python documentation as a code

			- decide what to do: previous git conventional commits article
				- ‚ùå https://github.com/darklab8/darklab_article_autogit
				- We have already better one. Perhaps no point to refactor
			- write article about cached dockerized CI:
				1) Calculate md5 hash from dependencies file lock onto libraries. Whatever your language is. Lets call the value as `builder_base_hash`
				2) Pull image image `{{ builder_base_hash }}` if it exists in docker registry, if not then build up to stage --builder. Save result to docker registry under tag ` {{ builder_base_hash }}`
				(Thus we implemented speed up twice for CI), as we are were able to cache half of longest CI in a way that its CI jobs can run at different runners, as we use remote for persistence
				3) run full building of an image, til the code capable to run unit tests and push to docker registry under tag ` build_${{ github.run_id }}`
				4) at unit test stage: pull the image ` build_${{ github.run_id }}` and run unit tests and other tests
				5) if it passed them, than save the image as `service_name_{{ github.run_number }}` as fit for deployment :slight_smile:, also mark it as `latest` and etc whatever tags u need
				Optionally build Github Actions. For md5 calculations. For golang, For Dagger CI? using Cue-lang? Experiment what to use.
			- Write an article about importantce of unit testing
