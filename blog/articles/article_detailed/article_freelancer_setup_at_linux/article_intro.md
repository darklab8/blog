## Intro

We show specifics for Kubuntu 22.04 LTS, but it should be usable for any Linux as long as you are able to install Lutris and having reasonable CPU architecture (we go with amd64). We organize article in paragraphs having next structure:

- How to start step/stage of installation
- What u see as progress and warning about possible pitifals
- Confirming that the step was completed succesfully.

In theory the same guide can be adopted for any Freelancer/mod installation. As well as serve as inspiration to how dockerize its server. There are [wine docker images](<https://hub.docker.com/r/scottyhardy/docker-wine/>), and it would be interesting to make it happen.

The guide was written on 2024.07.14 and last time checked it is all working on 2024.07.14.
