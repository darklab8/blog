## 8. Launching game

U should be having already selected Freelancer.exe as main `executable`

Launch the game :) You are ready. Close notes, agree to license and launch as normal.

And then i would recommend closing. Going to /home/naa/apps/freelancer_related/winreprefix_freelancer_vanilla/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Freelancer/PerfOptions.ini file and fixing your display for proper resolution before continuing to play further

```ini
[Display]
size= 1920, 1080
```

Now u are ready for sure ;)
