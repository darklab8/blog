## 8. Launching game

U should be having already selected Freelancer.exe as main `executable`

Launch the game :) You are ready. Close notes, agree to license and launch as normal.

And then i would recommend closing. Going to /home/naa/apps/freelancer_related/winreprefix_freelancer_vanilla/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Freelancer/PerfOptions.ini file and fixing your display for proper resolution before continuing to play further

```ini
[Display]
size= 1920, 1080
```

Now u are ready for sure ;)

## Extra info - Crashes on new game with 000c22fe, 000c21de offsets

WARNING: if you crash with weird errors 000c22fe, 000c21de on New Game, that can be because your "My Games" is symlinked to single place. Rename/delete existing ones to ensure u stat a fresh one not touched by other Freelancer mods.
