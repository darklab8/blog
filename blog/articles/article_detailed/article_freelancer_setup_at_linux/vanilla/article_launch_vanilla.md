## Extra info - Crashes on new game with 000c22fe, 000c21de offsets

WARNING: if you crash with weird errors 000c22fe, 000c21de on New Game, that can be because your "My Games" is symlinked to single place. Rename/delete existing ones to ensure u stat a fresh one not touched by other Freelancer mods.
