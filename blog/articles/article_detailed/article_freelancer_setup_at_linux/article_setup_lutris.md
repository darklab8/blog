## 1. Setup Lutris

Visit list of [lutris installating instructions](<https://lutris.net/downloads>)
Check your OS and install Lutris accordingly. Article guarantees all this stuff will work with lutris 0.5.16, how it will work with other versions is not guaranteed.

- Since we used Kubuntu, we downloaded [deb package](<https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.16>) for it
- and used `sudo apt install ./lutris_0.5.16_all.deb` for its installation

if you are able to launch Lutris and see it, the installation is succeful
