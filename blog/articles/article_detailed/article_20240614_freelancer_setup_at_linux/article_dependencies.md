Writing last versions of dependencies with which it was possible to make it happen:

    - CPU: Intel i5-10400 (12) @ 4.300GHz
    - GPU: Intel CometLake-S GT2 [UHD Graphics 630]
- `lutris/now 0.5.16 all [installed,upgradable to: 0.5.17]` ( output of `$ apt list --installed | grep "lutris"`)
- [Wine 9.0](<https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds/releases/download/9.0/wine-9.0-amd64.tar.xz>)
- wine gecko (32) 2.47.4 was installed by default! if u don't have one, Disco launcher at least may not work.
